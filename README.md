# SoftwareSunday
Projects/Files made during Purdue IEEE's Software Sunday program (Fall 2021)

In this 8 week course, students learn VueJS, some advanced HTML/CSS concepts, and UI/UNIX skills to 
create a website at the end of the 8 weeks as a "final project". Once this is
complete, the final project is submitted to Purdue University's College of
Engineering and the student is given an official certificate from the 
College of Engineering itself.
